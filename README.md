InnervationTrak is a simple addon that displays a list of player buffed by Spiritual Innervation on the Spiritbinder Gara'jal encounter. The display is heavily inspired by the early BigWigs proximity window and by the addon Atramedes.

Players are listed in decreasing percentage of a full buff stack. In other words, a 100% buffed player will be listed at the top of the window.
